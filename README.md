# Who is me?

My name is Lucas, but I'm also known as Calegari, Luqueta or LVKIN. I have 20 years old and I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

## This Project

I developed this test for Codeby, a company specializing in platforms E-commerce.

My stacks and approaches to this project: React.JS, Styled Components and Context API.

## Getting Start

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn setup`

for your first setup of this project, but after just `yarn start` is sufficient :).

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
